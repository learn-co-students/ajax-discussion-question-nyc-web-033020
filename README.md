# Discussion Questions: AJAX

## Objectives

* Identify synchronous and asynchronous code
* Describe the process of communicating with the server
* Process data successfully returned from fetch()

## Exercise

### Question 1

Given the following code list the order of console.logs:

```javascript
console.log("Hello")

fetch('https://randomuser.me/api/')
  .then( res => res.json() )
  .then( data => {
    console.log("Hi") 
  })

console.log("Sup?")
```

### Question 2

When fetchData is executed what will be console logged?

```javascript
function fetchData(){
        let data = fetch('https://randomuser.me/api/')
          .then( res => res.json() )
          .then( res => res )
        console.log(data)	
}

fetchData()
```

What will be console logged when the following code is run? Why?

```javascript
function fetchData(){
        let data = fetch('https://randomuser.me/api/')
          .then( res => res.json() )
          .then( json => console.log(json) )
}

fetchData()
```

What will be console logged when the following code is run? Why?

```javascript
function fetchData(){
        let data = fetch('https://randomuser.me/api/')
          .then( res => res.json() )
          .then( console.log )
}

fetchData()
```

### Question 3

In your own words: what does asynchronous mean?
Various things run at the same time. When JS gets a fetch, it will start to resolve that request while it finds other commands that can be completed at the same time.

### Question 4

Write out the request and response cycle. What is its purpose? How does it work?
The user sends a request to a server through a series of GET/POST/PATCH or whichever restful API. The server obtains the request and will return a response that can end in success (200) or any other error that it has encountered (400/500)

### Question 5

Check out the JSON you get from making a GET request to [this](https://randomuser.me/api/) url (https://randomuser.me/api/).

Open up the Github repository for this reading and view the provided `src/index.html` file in the browser. In `src/index.js`, make an AJAX request to that url when the button is clicked and append the retrieved information to the DOM. Use the labels to append the right data in the appropriate h4's, h3's and img tags.
